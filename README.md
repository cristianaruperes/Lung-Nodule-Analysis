# Lung Nodule Segmentation and Measurement.

In this project, I am working on our Private Dataset that we collected from Far Eastern Memorial Hospital. Using this data I did segmentation for the image and retrieve all information from the image then use that for measurement the size of lung nodule.

In summary, this study on Lung Nodule Analysis in CT Images, leveraging deep learning for segmentation and measurement, advances our understanding of medical image analysis. Various techniques and algorithms, including nodule masking, segmentation, and measurement, have been applied in this study.
The experimental results demonstrate that the new dataset (FEMH dataset) and the merged dataset yield improved outcomes compared to related studies, utilizing existing and powerful segmentation models. These results present a promising avenue to support healthcare professionals in real-world applications.
